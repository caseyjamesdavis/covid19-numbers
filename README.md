# covid19-numbers

&ensp;

### The purpose of this repo is to increase my own personal understanding of the pandemic.

&ensp;

My take on the COVID-19 data supplied by the *Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering* ([JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)) and the *New York Times* ([NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)).  The data from these sources tends to be about a day behind. 

The jupyter notebook files in this repo will pull down the data and generate the information summarized in the links below.
